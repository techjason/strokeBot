Maintain a Healthy Weight
Being overweight and obese significantly increases the risk of stroke. It’s suggested to maintain a healthy body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 to 22.9 kg/m2 for Asians.
（BMI= Weight（kg）/ Height（m））
A BMI over 23 is classified as overweight; over 25 as obese; and over 30 as morbidly obese. For overweight and obese individuals, a target weight loss of 5 – 10% in 6 months is suggested to reduce the risk of stroke and other chronic diseases. 
Eating for Post-Stroke Patients
After a stroke occurs, malnutrition is often noticed in stroke patients mainly due to reduced swallowing ability (dysphagia), reduced level of consciousness, poor oral hygiene, depression, reduced mobility, and arm, or facial weakness. Also, post-stroke depression can all influence food intake and nutritional status.
If the patient experiences dysphagia leading to malnutrition, the patient should be assessed by a multidisciplinary team including doctor, speech therapist, dietitian and physiotherapist as soon as possible for nutrition support.
